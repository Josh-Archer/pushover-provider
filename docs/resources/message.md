# pushover_message (Resource)

Sends a push notification via [Pushover](https://pushover.net) when this resource is created.

Because a sent message cannot be retrieved or deleted via the API, this resource models the *act of sending* rather than a persistent object. Any change to an attribute that is marked `(Forces replacement)` will destroy the existing resource and re-send the message with the new values.

To re-send a message without changing its content, use `terraform taint pushover_message.<name>` or add a `lifecycle { replace_triggered_by = [...] }` block referencing another resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic notification

```terraform
resource "pushover_message" "hello" {
  user_key = var.pushover_user_key
  message  = "Hello from Terraform!"
}
```

### Rich notification

```terraform
resource "pushover_message" "deploy" {
  user_key  = var.pushover_user_key
  message   = "Deploy of <b>my-app v2.3.0</b> completed in 42 s."
  title     = "✅ Deploy Complete"
  url       = "https://my-app.example.com"
  url_title = "Open Application"
  priority  = 1
  sound     = "magic"
  html      = true
}
```

### Emergency notification

```terraform
resource "pushover_message" "outage" {
  user_key = var.pushover_user_key
  message  = "Production database is unreachable!"
  title    = "🔴 Database Outage"
  priority = 2
  retry    = 60     # Resend every 60 seconds…
  expire   = 3600   # …for up to 1 hour
  callback = "https://ops.example.com/webhook/ack"
}

output "outage_receipt" {
  description = "Use this receipt to poll or cancel the emergency notification."
  value       = pushover_message.outage.receipt
}
```

### Send to a specific device

```terraform
resource "pushover_message" "targeted" {
  user_key = var.pushover_user_key
  message  = "This message goes to your iPhone only."
  device   = "iphone"
}
```

## Import

`pushover_message` resources cannot be imported because Pushover does not expose a message-retrieval API.
